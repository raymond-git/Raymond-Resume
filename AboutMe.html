  <p/>I am multilingual in English, Cantonese, and Tashainese. Born and raised in San Francisco, I was constantly exposed to the wealth of development in technology. As a direct result, I had an interest in technology since I was young. My interest, however, was in no way restricted to one single platform in technology as I found interest in building desktops, learning about operating systems of the hardware I had experience interacting with and ever growing curiosity in developing web pages from scratch. With such multiple interests in technology, I often struggle to decide on a specific career path. I have a passion or a variety of different aspects of the technology field, but I recently found out my strongest passion to lie within web design. After taking one class in web design, I found myself spending hours learning about HTML, CSS and Javascript in my leisure time. That's when I realized I want to become a web designer.
   </p>
  <p> Throughout the process of learning, I have developed some basic HTML/CSS skills. Utilizing this newfound knowledge, I was able to create a simple webpage, such as this one. This is my first project/web page I've created and I am quite proud with it. I have always enjoyed the idea of having my own personal website and being able to create one on my own is a fantastic feeling. I hope to continue learning and become proficient in designing web pages so that one day I'll get an internship, work at a technology company or possibly do some freelance work. Eventually, I would like to becoming a full stack developer. My overall goal is to continue to grow and never stop learning. Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me!
